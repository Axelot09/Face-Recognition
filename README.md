# Face-Recognition

This face recognition project is a Python-based application with a user-friendly graphical interface for real-time face detection. Utilizing OpenCV and Tkinter, the program captures live video feed from a webcam, detects faces within the frames using a pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier, and visually marks each detected face with a rectangle labeled “Person”.
